# flow - Workflow Runtime Toolchain

`flow` is the command-line tool for executing, managing, and debugging JOEL workflows.

## Installation

`flow` is included with JOEL:

```bash
flow --version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Execute workflow
flow run workflow.joel

# Start workflow server
flow server

# Monitor workflow execution
flow monitor workflow-id
```

## Execute Workflows

Run workflow files:

```bash
# Execute workflow
flow run workflow.joel

# Execute with parameters
flow run workflow.joel --param input=data.json

# Execute with environment variables
flow run workflow.joel --env

# Execute in background
flow run workflow.joel --background

# Execute with timeout
flow run workflow.joel --timeout 300
```

## Workflow Server

Start workflow execution server:

```bash
# Start server
flow server

# Start on specific port
flow server --port 8080

# Start with specific backend
flow server --backend redis

# Start in cluster mode
flow server --cluster
```

## Workflow Management

Manage workflow executions:

```bash
# List running workflows
flow list

# Show workflow status
flow status workflow-id

# Stop workflow
flow stop workflow-id

# Resume workflow
flow resume workflow-id

# Cancel workflow
flow cancel workflow-id
```

## Monitoring

Monitor workflow execution:

```bash
# Monitor workflow
flow monitor workflow-id

# Show workflow logs
flow logs workflow-id

# Show workflow metrics
flow metrics workflow-id

# Show workflow graph
flow graph workflow-id
```

## Workflow Debugging

Debug workflow execution:

```bash
# Debug workflow
flow debug workflow.joel

# Step through workflow
flow step workflow-id

# Set breakpoints
flow breakpoint workflow.joel --line 10

# Inspect workflow state
flow inspect workflow-id
```

## Workflow Scheduling

Schedule workflow execution:

```bash
# Schedule workflow
flow schedule workflow.joel --cron "0 0 * * *"

# List scheduled workflows
flow schedule list

# Remove schedule
flow schedule remove schedule-id
```

## Examples

### Execute Workflow

```bash
flow run data-pipeline.joel
```

**Input (data-pipeline.joel):**
```joel
[Compiled]

flow data_pipeline {
  node fetch {
    fn execute() {
      # Fetch data
    }
  }
  
  node process {
    depends: [fetch],
    fn execute() {
      # Process data
    }
  }
  
  node store {
    depends: [process],
    fn execute() {
      # Store results
    }
  }
}
```

### Monitor Execution

```bash
# Start workflow
flow run workflow.joel --background

# Monitor in real-time
flow monitor <workflow-id>
```
