Frequently asked questions about JOEL.

## General

### What is JOEL?

JOEL is a polymodal programming language that can be compiled or interpreted, designed to work across systems, AI, Web3, UI, and more.

### Why create JOEL?

To eliminate context switching between different languages and tools. Write everything in one language.

### Is JOEL production-ready?

JOEL is currently in Phase 1 MVP (v0.1.0). Core features work, but many advanced features are still in development.

## Language

### What's the difference between [Compiled] and [Interpreted]?

- **Interpreted**: Fast development, dynamic types, VM execution
- **Compiled**: High performance, static types, native/WASM/EVM output

### Does JOEL have garbage collection?

In interpreted mode, yes. In compiled mode, it uses ownership semantics (Rust-like) to avoid GC.

### Can I use JOEL with existing libraries?

Yes, via FFI (Foreign Function Interface):
- `ffi c` - C libraries
- `ffi python` - Python libraries
- `ffi node` - Node.js modules

### How do I install JOEL?

See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation).

### How do I contribute?

JOEL is open source. Contributions welcome! Check the GitHub repository.

### What IDE should I use?

Any editor works. Syntax highlighting and LSP support coming soon.

## Deployment
