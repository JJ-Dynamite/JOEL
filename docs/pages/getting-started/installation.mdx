# Installation

This guide will help you install JOEL on your system.

## Prerequisites

JOEL is written in Rust, so you'll need:

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Cargo** - Comes with Rust installation

### Verify Installation

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Installation Methods

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

Use the provided installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL

# Run the install script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the `joel` binary in release mode
2. Install it to `/usr/local/bin/joel`
3. Make it available globally

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL

# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# Install globally (requires sudo)
sudo cp target/release/joel /usr/local/bin/joel
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/joel
```

### Option 3: Local Installation (No sudo)

If you don't have sudo access:

```bash
# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# Add to your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that `joel` is available:

```bash
joel version
```

You should see:

```
JOEL Language v0.1.0
A polymodal programming language
```

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### macOS

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install JOEL
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL
./install.sh
```

### Linux

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install JOEL
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL
./install.sh
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
# Download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/

# Install JOEL
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL
cargo build --release

# Add to PATH manually or use:
# Copy target\release\joel.exe to a directory in your PATH
```

## Building from Source

If you want to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL

# Build in debug mode (faster compilation)
cargo build

# Build in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at:
# Debug: target/debug/joel
# Release: target/release/joel
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: cargo"

Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### "Permission denied" during installation

Use `sudo` for system-wide installation, or use Option 3 (local installation).

### "joel: command not found" after installation

Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH | grep /usr/local/bin
```

If not, add it:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
```

### Build errors

Make sure you have the latest Rust version:

```bash
rustup update
```

## Uninstallation

To remove JOEL:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/joel
```
