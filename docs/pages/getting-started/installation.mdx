# Installation

Install JOEL with a single command:

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://joel.val-x.com/install | bash
```

This will:
1. Download the latest JOEL release
2. Build the `joel` binary
3. Install it to `/usr/local/bin/joel`
4. Make it available globally

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that `joel` is available:

```bash
joel version
```

You should see:

```
JOEL Language v0.1.0
A polymodal programming language
```

## Alternative Installation Methods

### From Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL

# Build and install
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/joel /usr/local/bin/joel
```

### Local Installation (No sudo)

If you don't have sudo access:

```bash
# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# Add to your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
```

## Prerequisites

JOEL is written in Rust, so you'll need:

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Cargo** - Comes with Rust installation

### Install Rust

If you don't have Rust installed:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### macOS

```bash
# Install Rust (if needed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install JOEL
curl -fsSL https://joel.val-x.com/install | bash
```

### Linux

```bash
# Install Rust (if needed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install JOEL
curl -fsSL https://joel.val-x.com/install | bash
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/

# Install JOEL
git clone https://github.com/JJ-Dynamite/JOEL.git
cd JOEL
cargo build --release
# Add target\release\joel.exe to your PATH
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found: cargo"

Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### "joel: command not found" after installation

Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH | grep /usr/local/bin
```

If not, add it:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
```

### Build errors

Make sure you have the latest Rust version:

```bash
rustup update
```

## Uninstallation

To remove JOEL:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/joel
```
